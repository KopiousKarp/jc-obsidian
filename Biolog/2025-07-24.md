Each day should be encapsulated in a daily note

Forecast: We will probably complete today and tomorrows reports by the time I leave today. 

Had a #QCMALDI today. Powder ID'd as L. Plantarum instead of the expected L. Salivarius

Gianna gave me a set of monday batches to complete as well. By complete, I mean that I need to push them through platecheck before I leave today.
Earlier I noticed that MUR-0076 has a missing POP-fail report
08:42:03
The POP-fail report will have to wait due to #SARI not being able to report IA without a concise alignment in the reporting tab

I remembered that I need to start drafting my [[email to Dr. Sparks]]

#QCMALDI came back inconclusive (no peaks, wtf is MALDI even good for?)
Gave it a Do Over
