### Erin's email

Joe,

I’m including your new advisor and Dr. Hoober here to ensure everyone is on the same page. 

First of all, it is not appropriate to state that you plan to publish data you used from our lab that is currently unpublished. You should have consulted with me about the use of this data and whether they can be published. It was my understanding that you were using this data to develop image analysis pipelines, but since you have not contacted me for a year, I assumed your project was no longer moving forward.

I’ll also state that it’s inappropriate to ask me and others in the lab to serve on your thesis committee with a few weeks’ notice. As you know, it’s field season, which means everyone is busy. Your lack of planning should not become other people’s responsibility.

Lastly for your request, the short answer is no – this data cannot be published, and you cannot ask Than for additional details. Ashley has already published the brace root phenotypes of these lines and shown they are distinguishable.  We have initiated independent efforts to resolve these data, which would be undermined by your use in a publication. Again, this could have been avoided if you maintained contact while using our data.  Any publicly available data from Ashley’s paper can be used, but unpublished BRobot images cannot be used.

### Drafting my response

Dear Dr. Sparks, 
I'm including my advisor and Dr. Hoober here, as you've been ghosting their efforts to get in touch. 
Please forgive me if I am overly clear, as I see a few misunderstandings from our emails and I want to avoid that in the future. 

Firstly, you have a correct understanding that I used the images to build a pipeline, that pipeline was described in the thesis document that I shared with you, along with an email that I sent to you over a month ago. I will remark that it would have been appropriate to send a simple "no" to that email, requesting that you be a committee member, but I was also content to say that you had simply missed it due to the field season.  

I'd like to apologize for not emailing you sooner, I saw you on the green and made it pretty clear to you that Dr. Barner and I had something promising and I was going to complete my masters finishing this project. Forgive me for feeling unwelcome and wanting to approach you with a finished product instead of progress reports. A few weeks after we spoke, we saw each other on the Green again and I was promptly looked off by you and your husband gracefully gave me the middle finger from across the courtyard. 

Now I thought this was already made clear in every communication that I've had with you, but I have never intended to publish your data without collaborating with you first. That's why I asked you if you had time for a meeting, and that question still stands, as you've avoided it from both me and Dr. Hoober now.
