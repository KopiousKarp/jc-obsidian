My draft to Erin:

Joe,

I’m including your new advisor and Dr. Hoober here to ensure everyone is on the same page. 

First of all, it is not appropriate to state that you plan to publish data you used from our lab that is currently unpublished. You should have consulted with me about the use of this data and whether they can be published. It was my understanding that you were using this data to develop image analysis pipelines, but since you have not contacted me for a year, I assumed your project was no longer moving forward.

I’ll also state that it’s inappropriate to ask me and others in the lab to serve on your thesis committee with a few weeks’ notice. As you know, it’s field season, which means everyone is busy. Your lack of planning should not become other people’s responsibility.

Lastly for your request, the short answer is no – this data cannot be published, and you cannot ask Than for additional details. Ashley has already published the brace root phenotypes of these lines and shown they are distinguishable.  We have initiated independent efforts to resolve these data, which would be undermined by your use in a publication. Again, this could have been avoided if you maintained contact while using our data.  Any publicly available data from Ashley’s paper can be used, but unpublished BRobot images cannot be used.
