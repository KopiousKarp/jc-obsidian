Goal for today is to push monday to be ready to verify. 
- handle standards (STD) and small batches of next days (ND) for today
- move on to monday and complete that throughout the day
I like having the entire days work set before me like this, its relaxing. Since I have some autonomy over the day, I'll take my time to be efficient. 

No monday batches are reported yet unless I accidentally reported them 


Friday stuff that needs doing 
- GEL-0013 DO  assembled (09:05:50)  
- WET-0050 is being sequenced
- SCH-0003 DO  assembled (09:05:50)
- FLE-0005 needs plate check (PC) and verify
- ENV-0393 has a reseq that will come off later today 09:05:29


So am I, still waiting 09:07:52
- WET-0050 
- ENV-0393
Going on the sequencer
