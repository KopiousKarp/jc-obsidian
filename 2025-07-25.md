Goal for today is to push monday to be ready to verify. 
- handle standards (STD) and small batches of next days (ND) for today
- move on to monday and complete that throughout the day
I like having the entire days work set before me like this, its relaxing. Since I have some autonomy over the day, I'll take my time to be efficient. 

No monday batches are reported yet unless I accidentally reported them 


Friday stuff that needs doing 
- GEL-0013 DO 
- WET-0050 is being sequenced
- SCH-0003 DO 
- FLE-0005 needs plate check (PC) and verify
