As mentioned in the [[my_obsidian/readme]] I want to shift all of my AI use to locally hosted models.

Things that I want to have:
- openAI voice to text integration. I really like it on chatgpt. speeds things up 
- autotagger in obsidian
- auto summaries in the readme's of my obsidian
- agentic documentation in obsidian
-  VScode integration
