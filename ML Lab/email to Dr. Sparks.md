### Erin's email

Joe,

I’m including your new advisor and Dr. Hoober here to ensure everyone is on the same page. 

First of all, it is not appropriate to state that you plan to publish data you used from our lab that is currently unpublished. You should have consulted with me about the use of this data and whether they can be published. It was my understanding that you were using this data to develop image analysis pipelines, but since you have not contacted me for a year, I assumed your project was no longer moving forward.

I’ll also state that it’s inappropriate to ask me and others in the lab to serve on your thesis committee with a few weeks’ notice. As you know, it’s field season, which means everyone is busy. Your lack of planning should not become other people’s responsibility.

Lastly for your request, the short answer is no – this data cannot be published, and you cannot ask Than for additional details. Ashley has already published the brace root phenotypes of these lines and shown they are distinguishable.  We have initiated independent efforts to resolve these data, which would be undermined by your use in a publication. Again, this could have been avoided if you maintained contact while using our data.  Any publicly available data from Ashley’s paper can be used, but unpublished BRobot images cannot be used.

### Drafting my response
#### Raw anger
Dear Dr. Sparks, 
I'm including Dr. Barner and Dr. Hoober here, as you've been ghosting their efforts to get in touch. Please forgive me if I am too explicit. In your email, I see a few misunderstandings and I want to avoid the obtusity in the future. 

Firstly, you have a correct understanding that I used the images to build a pipeline, that pipeline was described in the thesis document that I shared with you, along with an email that I sent to you over a month ago. I will remark that it would have been appropriate to send a simple "no" to my request that you be a committee member, but I was also content to say that you had simply missed it, due to the field season, of course.  

I'd like to apologize for not emailing you sooner, I saw you on the green in October and made it pretty clear to you that Dr. Barner and I had a promising project going and I was going to complete my masters finishing this project. Forgive me for feeling unwelcome and wanting to approach you with a finished product instead of progress reports. A few weeks after we spoke, we saw each other on the Green again and I was promptly looked off by you, as your lab manager(husband) gave me the middle finger from across the courtyard. I had assumed that you were too busy with the move to chat from that point forward. 

Now I thought this was already made clear in every communication that I've had with you, but I have never intended to publish your data without collaborating with you first, and your authorship of the resulting paper was agreed upon before I even left the lab. That's why I asked you if you had time for a meeting, thats why Dr. Hoober has asked for a meeting. I have ~420 images with annotations that I made, that is a very small amount and it is sampled in a way that cannot undermine your current experiments. If you have launched efforts to resolve the data, then just connect me with the person doing it and I can collaborate with them. I am certain that 
I can help. 

I await patiently, be it till the end of the field season or indefinitely, for you to get your head out of your ass and hop on a zoom call. 

Cheers, 
J. Cristiano



#### Sympathy draft (gpt 4.5)
Dear Dr. Sparks,

Thank you for including Dr. Barner and Dr. Hoober—I'm glad we can clarify this together.

First, I apologize for any misunderstanding regarding the use of your lab’s data. You are correct that the primary purpose of the images was to build and validate an image analysis pipeline, as detailed in the thesis draft I shared last month. To clarify explicitly, my intention was never to publish these images without your involvement or consent. As we previously discussed, my hope was always to collaborate with you, ensuring appropriate authorship and acknowledgment of your contribution of the data.

Regarding the thesis committee, I acknowledge that the timing coincides with your busy field season. My request was made in the hope that your perspective would enhance my thesis, but I understand your constraints.

I'd also like to address why I have been out of contact. After our conversation on the Green in October, when I confirmed that I would be writing my thesis on this project, I sensed some distance and mistakenly assumed you were not wanting to chat while dealing with the move. My intention was to approach you with tangible results rather than incremental updates, but clearly, maintaining consistent communication would have been better.

Finally, regarding the ongoing work in your lab, please understand that my objective is solely collaborative. My annotated dataset is small (~420 images), and I am confident it would not compromise your ongoing analyses. If you are open to it, I would greatly appreciate connecting with whoever is working on this in your lab to see how I might support or complement your current efforts.

I would be grateful for the opportunity to discuss this further, even if that must wait until after the busy field season.

Thank you again for your understanding.

Warm regards,  
Joseph Cristiano
