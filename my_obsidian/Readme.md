This folder is where I will keep all of my notes regarding how I use and organize my obsidian vault

### My Rules
Projects are organized into folders. At the base of each folder, should be a readme file. 
>Rabbit holes should always be marked with a readme
### Feature set that I need
- use git to synchronize notebooks/vaults [[Git integration]]
- integrate my browser to be able to save web pages quickly 
- integrate .bib citations


### LLM Integration
- search available plugins for local AI stuff 
- RAG and similarity searches to aid in connections and links in obsidian
