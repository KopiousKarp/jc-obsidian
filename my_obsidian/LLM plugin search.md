I found and downloaded [this plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=llm-tagger) that does nothing other than use local llms to tag the notes that are created here but I would also like it to do more. no automated notes, but instead, I want it to create tags, upkeep the knowledge graph, and eventually, become an aid to thought that automatically reminds me about things that I have noted before.
